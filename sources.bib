  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
  abstract = {Interactions with neutrons and protons play a crucial role for
	      the neutrino opacity of matter in the supernova core. Their
	      current implementation in many simulation codes, however, is
	      rather schematic and ignores not only modifications for the
	      correlated nuclear medium of the nascent neutron star, but also
	      free-space corrections from nucleon recoil, weak magnetism, or
	      strange quarks, which can easily add up to changes of several 10%
	      for neutrino energies in the spectral peak. In the Garching
	      supernova simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, such
	      sophistications have been included for a long time except for the
	      strange-quark contributions to the nucleon spin, which affect
	      neutral-current neutrino scattering. We demonstrate on the basis
	      of a 20  progenitor star that a moderate strangeness-dependent
	      contribution of  to the axial-vector coupling constant  can turn
	      an unsuccessful three-dimensional (3D) model into a successful
	      explosion. Such a modification is in the direction of current
	      experimental results and reduces the neutral-current scattering
	      opacity of neutrons, which dominate in the medium around and
	      above the neutrinosphere. This leads to increased luminosities
	      and mean energies of all neutrino species and strengthens the
	      neutrino-energy deposition in the heating layer. Higher nonradial
	      kinetic energy in the gain layer signals enhanced buoyancy
	      activity that enables the onset of the explosion at ∼300 ms after
	      bounce, in contrast to the model with vanishing strangeness
	      contributions to neutrino–nucleon scattering. Our results
	      demonstrate the close proximity to explosion of the previously
	      published, unsuccessful 3D models of the Garching group.}
