	author = {Askaryan, G A},
	abstractNote = {An investigation is carried out on the excess of electrons in an electron--photon shower caused by annihilation of the positrons in flight and participation of Compton and sigma electrons in the shower. It is shown that at the maximum of the shower the excess may comprise ten percents of the total number of shower particles. The Cherenkov radiation from this excess charge in a dense medium is estimated. The possibility of recording and using this radio emission from showers produced by high energy accelerator particles or cosmic ray in blocks of dense matter is indicated. The possibility of recording radio waves from penetrating particle showers in the ground on the moon by apparatus thrown on the lunar surface and in underground layers on the earth, in which radio waves can propagate, is also noted.
