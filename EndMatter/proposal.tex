As this method seems to be a viable way of measuring the index of refraction,
it might be a good idea to have a more controllable radio wave source fly
closer to the detectors to make more accurate measurements, e.g an
autonomous\footnote{as to not have it need a radio controller, causing RF
interference on top of the one coming from the engine and also as autonomous
GNSS positioning is always more accurate than human steering} drone with an
antenna strapped to it or just some form of stationed antenna.  Assuming
Schytt's equation to hold completely, ideally we'd like data in between the
depths of 20-100m as this is where the biggest discrepancies might be observed
between the single exponential model and the converted density data as is
depicted on figure \ref{fig:IndexVSDepth.pdf}. 

It might also be a good idea to make the signal easier to fit, thus reducing the possible 
error on timing, e.g by making the signal a known AM signal.

In the ideal case we'd want some immobile close source and a phased array which we'll
move down every couple of measurements, thus obtaining an index-depth profile
using direct measurements.
