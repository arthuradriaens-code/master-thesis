The hybrid ray tracer developed over the course of this thesis and reported in
chapter \ref{chapter:hybrid} was a success, not only is it more accurate than
it's predecessors, as shown in figures \ref{fig:acchyb} and \ref{fig:accit},
 but it's also faster by about 34\%.  The accuracy of the ray tracer also
makes it perfectly suitable for very fine precision simulations as used within
the Balloon radio wave systematic error prediction.

The use of weather balloons to estimate the index of refraction as
was reported in \ref{chap:WB} was also done successfully 
yielding the following data:

It can be argued, as the fits are consistently below the exponential model,
that this data shows a shortcoming of the model.  Because of this we reason
that there's a need to investigate the index-depth relation further through 
experiments.

As there are a multitude of events (as can be found in appendices
\ref{app:5Deg} and \ref{app:10Deg}) but only finite time to analyze each and
every one, this code is also made public \cite{projects-mt} as to make
it accesible to improve on this work.  

As this method seems to be a viable way of measuring the index of refraction,
we'd want to use this method to determine a index-depth profile
As has been done in the South Polar firn\cite{kravchenko_besson_meyers_2004}.
To do this we'd want some immobile close source and a phased array which we'll
move down every couple of measurements. thus obtaining an index-depth profile
using direct measurements. This might be carried out e.g during deployment
of a new station's power string.
