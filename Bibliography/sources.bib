  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
  abstract = {Interactions with neutrons and protons play a crucial role for
	      the neutrino opacity of matter in the supernova core. Their
	      current implementation in many simulation codes, however, is
	      rather schematic and ignores not only modifications for the
	      correlated nuclear medium of the nascent neutron star, but also
	      free-space corrections from nucleon recoil, weak magnetism, or
	      strange quarks, which can easily add up to changes of several 10%
	      for neutrino energies in the spectral peak. In the Garching
	      supernova simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, such
	      sophistications have been included for a long time except for the
	      strange-quark contributions to the nucleon spin, which affect
	      neutral-current neutrino scattering. We demonstrate on the basis
	      of a 20  progenitor star that a moderate strangeness-dependent
	      contribution of  to the axial-vector coupling constant  can turn
	      an unsuccessful three-dimensional (3D) model into a successful
	      explosion. Such a modification is in the direction of current
	      experimental results and reduces the neutral-current scattering
	      opacity of neutrons, which dominate in the medium around and
	      above the neutrinosphere. This leads to increased luminosities
	      and mean energies of all neutrino species and strengthens the
	      neutrino-energy deposition in the heating layer. Higher nonradial
	      kinetic energy in the gain layer signals enhanced buoyancy
	      activity that enables the onset of the explosion at ∼300 ms after
	      bounce, in contrast to the model with vanishing strangeness
	      contributions to neutrino–nucleon scattering. Our results
	      demonstrate the close proximity to explosion of the previously
	      published, unsuccessful 3D models of the Garching group.}

abstract={The detection of high-energy neutrinos in the EeV range requires new detection techniques to cope with the small expected flux. The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models. Finally, the implications and opportunities for neutrino detection are discussed.},

abstract = {The first flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment recorded 16 radio signals that were emitted by cosmic-ray induced air showers. The dominant contribution to the radiation comes from the deflection of positrons and electrons in the geomagnetic field, which is beamed in the direction of motion of the air shower. For 14 of these events, this radiation is reflected from the ice and subsequently detected by the ANITA experiment at a flight altitude of ∼36 km. In this paper, we estimate the energy of the 14 individual events and find that the mean energy of the cosmic-ray sample is 2.9 × 1018 eV, which is significantly lower than the previous estimate. By simulating the ANITA flight, we calculate its exposure for ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We estimate for the first time the cosmic-ray flux derived only from radio observations and find agreement with measurements performed at other observatories. In addition, we find that the ANITA data set is consistent with Monte Carlo simulations for the total number of observed events and with the properties of those events.}

abstract = {The success in using VHF and UHF frequency systems for sounding polar ice sheets has been tempered by an uncertainty in the in-situ dielectric constant which controls the effective velocity of an electromagnetic wave propagating in an air-ice mixture. An empirical equation for determining the relative real dielectric constant ϵ′r vs. density (specific gravity ϱ) of firn or ice was proposed in 1969 by Robin et al. where ϵ′r = (1 + 0.851 ϱ)2. However, this expression has met with uncertainty because wide-angle radar refraction sounding techniques have produced dielectric constant values that are lower than Robin's equation predicts. This paper discusses radar soundings made on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica, and compares the resulting dielectric constant determinations with Robin's equation, laboratory measurements on firn and ice and other expressions given in the literature for determining ϵ′r vs. the specific gravity of dry firn and ice. Our findings indicate that the form of Robin's equation is valid. Our analysis also indicates the expression could be slightly improved to read ϵ′r = (1+0.845ϱ)2. Reasons are suggested as to why previous wide-angle radar sounding studies did not reproduce Robin's findings.}

 abstract = {Experimental results are presented from a traverse over the ice sheet of north western Greenland in 1964, during which a continuously recorded profile of ice thickness was obtained for the first time. Interpretation of data from this traverse is consistent with results of subsequent work to December 1967. The parameters of the apparatus are presented briefly, while the details of electronic circuits are being published separately. Theoretical problems of radio wave propagation in an ice sheet and, in particular, the factors affecting accuracy are discussed. The uncertainty in depth, over a small area, is ± 5 m ± 1.5% and this is verified by comparison with the seismic results for a range of depths up to 1.5 km. It is found that the only real uncertainty arises in irregular terrain. The effectiveness of the radio echo technique is dependent on the absorption of radio waves in ice. Temperature, and to a lesser extent the impurity content of ice, appear to be the main variables affecting field performance. Earlier laboratory results on the variation of absorption with temperature for ice cores from northwest Greenland, together with theoretically predicted temperature distributions throughout the ice mass, have provided estimates of the total loss by absorption. These estimates are reasonably consistent with the observed echo strengths over most of the traverse. Consequently, it is predicted that echoes can be obtained over considerable areas of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, as has been verified by subsequent observations. The reflexion coefficient at the ice/rock interface is of the order of -15 dB. It could rise to 0 dB for an ice/water interface and one area was found in Greenland where it appeared to fall to -30 dB. Results from this traverse have shown that local surface slopes on the ice sheet are largely controlled by variations of longitudinal stress along the line of flow. Regional slopes over several kilometres vary with the velocity of movement of the ice, but appear to be less dependent on basal ice temperatures than laboratory results would suggest. The velocity of ice movement increases in proportion to the square or cube of the basal shear stress, but the stress itself shows no obvious dependence on basal ice temperature. Partially reflecting layers discovered within the ice mass are discussed mainly in terms of small density variations between adjacent layers of ice. One particularly prominent layer is calculated to be about 1000 years old and its variation of depth with position provides evidence in favour of the steady state model of the ice sheet.},

abstract = {The Homestake Solar Neutrino Detector, based on the inverse beta-decay reaction νe +37Cl →37Ar + e-, has been measuring the flux of solar neutrinos since 1970. The experiment has operated in a stable manner throughout this time period. All aspects of this detector are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the determination of the extraction and counting efficiencies, the key experimental parameters that are necessary to convert the measured 37Ar count rate to the solar neutrino production rate. A thorough consideration is also given to the systematics of the detector, including the measurement of the extraction and counting efficiencies and the nonsolar production of 37Ar. The combined result of 108 extractions is a solar neutrino-induced 37Ar production rate of 2.56 ± 0.l6 (statistical) ± 0.16 (systematic) SNU.}
